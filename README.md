Super Mart Management System Welcome to the Super Mart Management System project! This C program simulates a multi-floor supermarket with both administrator and customer functionalities. It's designed to manage products across different floors, handle customer purchases, and generate bills. This project demonstrates file handling, structures, and user interaction in C programming.
